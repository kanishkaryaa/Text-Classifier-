Text Classifier built using the existing neural network package provided by tensorflow at "https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim50/2" which works with 50 embedding dimesions. For a more complex model, the same NN architecture is available with 128 embedded dimensions. Dataset used is imdb_reviews which is directly downloaded using the tensorlow_datasets(imported as tsdf) in the the notebook having a size of apporximately 82 MegaBytes. 
The text in the dataset is not pre processed and is processed by the neural network at the time of learning.
The dataset contains around 50,000 entries which is split into train and test data each of which, contains 25,000 entries each
The datasets contains text(str) which represents the reviews and labels as either 0 or 1. 0 indicates a negative review whereas 1 indicates a positive review.
The accuracy score of the model is 86.41% which can be increased by using more complex optimizers though here, binary crossentropy is applied along with the adam optimizer.
